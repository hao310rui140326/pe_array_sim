This direction contains code that generates quartus projects of many small PE
arrays, in order to have enough data to generate a model in
pe_arary_area_model.h.

To generate the quartus projects, run this command:

$ make projects

Once the quartus projects are generated, each one should be built in Quartus by
running the build.sh script in each quartus project directory. The script
run_on_farm.sh can be used to help automate this process on an ARC farm.

Once the quartus projects have been built, parse the data and generate a new
pe_array_area_model.h by running this command:

$ make model

The new area model header will be generated in the build directory. To use it,
move the new header into the inc directory and replace the existing header.
Once this is done, you can do a sanity check to compare the area model in the
header to the quartus projects once more:

$ make check

To control the corners used when building the area model, modify the main.cpp
file.
