This directory contains some code that generates parameterizations of the PE
array which try to achieve either some specific resource usage (for example, 80% of
the ALMs on the chip and 100% of the DSPs and M20Ks) or you can compile a
specific architecture. If generating specific resource usage you can then generate
a series of CSV files which contain the estimated area, number of PEs, and estimated
TOPS for each parameterization. This allows different modes to be easily compared, identifying
 which one would give the best performance in a specific chip area.

To generate the CSV files, run this command:

$ make csv

Until quartus projects are generated and built, the CSV files will only contain
area estimates. To generate quartus projects, run this command:

$ make projects

To generate the quartus projects for specific architectures use:

$ make arch

Once the quartus projects are generated, each one should be built in Quartus by
running the build.sh script in each quartus project directory. The script
run_on_farm.sh can be used to help automate this process on an ARC farm.

If the quartus projects were generated and built by the `projects' flow, you can
run "make csv" to generate new CSV files which contain both the area estimates
along with the actual data collected from the quartus projects.

To control which CSV files and quartus projects are generated and the
configuration options used, modify the main.cpp file.
