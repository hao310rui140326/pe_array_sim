This directory contains the modelsim simulation test for the PE array. It runs
a test which ensures that the Verilog implementation of the PE array matches
the implementation in pe_array_model.h by sending random numbers through both
and checking that the outputs match exactly.

To compile and run all of the tests, run this command:

  make run

If you run all of the tests, it will probably take a few hours. If you just
want to run one of the tests, run this command:

  make run TEST=<test name or test number>

You can pass either a test name or a test number. For example, both of these
will work:

  make run TEST=12
  make run TEST=fe5_fi5_nr2_nc1_np2_nd1_nfe1_nfi2_ram512_dot4_nalm0_a1_s0

Alternatively, if you would rather use the makefile just to compile the code
and want to run the resulting test binary yourself, then use these commands:

  make
  cd build && ./test_runner <test name or test number>
